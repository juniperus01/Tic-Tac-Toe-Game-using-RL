# Undefeatable Tic Tac Toe game

## Objective 
Training a tic tac toe game with Reinforcement learning to improve the AIâ€™s success rate with experience.

## Introduction 
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. By exploring its environment and exploiting the most rewarding steps, it learns to choose the best action at each stage.

Here, I have implemented the grid game by iteratively updating Q value function, which is the estimating value of (state, action) pair.

## Language
Python and Python modules (pygame, pygame-menu, csv)
